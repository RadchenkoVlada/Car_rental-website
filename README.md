# Car rental website
There is a website for car rental company (non-commercial)
## Tools
HTML, CSS, Python 3, framework Django, Database sqlite and so on... 

## Domain Description

My task is to track the financial performance of the rental. There are a number of **cars** of various brands in your fleet, which are additionally stored data such as
* car number
* cost
* year of manufacture 
* type

Each car has its own rental cost.

**Customers** apply to the rental center. All customers are required to register, in which standard information 
* last name 
* first name
* address
* telephone number 

is collected about them.\
But on the other hand, you can be a guest and first pick up a car for yourself, and then register.
\
All quoted rates are fully cancellable before 48 hours before pick up the car.

When a car is issued a **contract** is concluded. Each contract includes the 
* contract number
* the date of issue
* the expected date of return

The cost of car rental should depend not only on the car itself, but also on the period of its rental.

After the expiration of the rental contract, the client is obliged to return the car in proper form. When the car is returned in an improper form, the client pays a fixed set of fines (a single penalty for damage to property and the cost of repairing the car).
